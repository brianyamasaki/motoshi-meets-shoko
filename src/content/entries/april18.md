Shoko didn't sleep at all. I dozed [unreadable] on and off so I'm not too bad off. Very tiring trip. 20 1/2 hour on train. It was raining till we reached Kobe. Cleared after that and cloudless from Matsuyama on.
Reached Yawatahama on 7:44PM. Mrs. Matsumoto, Hamamoto and Motoyasu with 3 children were there.
