Stayed home all morning and most of afternoon. 
Mother Nihira took me to Inokashira Park, next train stop. It's good size park with lake, zoo and aquarium. Went to Kinoshita and was there til Shoko called on the way home from work. She was waiting for me at the station. 
Japan had peaceful May Day.
