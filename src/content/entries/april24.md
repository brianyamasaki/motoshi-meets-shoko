Today is clear day so had walked thru maple valley. Wonderful day. 
Took 12:57 train for Osaka. Had station travelers aid get us one hotel but was lousy place
so Shoko's father's friend introduced us to Gate Buro Yotei. Very interesting and fascinating place. Went into Roten Buro tonight (actually 1:00AM)
