Came back from Yokohama this morning. I also took 3 passport size picture for Japanese side. Mr. Oikawa came to say goodbye. He said his job is done and that he is returning to a country and take care of his inflamed stomach. No ulcer or cancer however. Chieko and I went to see Taiho Chushingura [also in Japanese]
