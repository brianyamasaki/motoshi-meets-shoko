Shoko went to work today. I went to American Consulate with Shoko's preliminary application for visa. 
Brought bank account and copy of income tax return. 
Stopped by at Kinoshita and watched TV till Shoko called. It started to rain. 
Shoko met me at the station w/umbrella. It was past 11:00. Send wire for more money.
